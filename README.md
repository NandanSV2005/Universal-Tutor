## 📂 Sample Answer Structure

**Question:** Explain the electroless copper deposition process.  

**Answer:**  

**1️⃣ Explanation:**  
- **Cleaning & Desmearing:** Removes drilling residues.  
- **Conditioning:** Swells via walls for catalyst absorption.  
- **Catalyzation:** `$SnCl_2$` reduces `$Pd^{2+}$` to `$Pd^0$`, creating catalytic sites.  
- **Acceleration:** Removes excess tin, exposes Pd nuclei.  
- **Electroless Copper Deposition:** Immersion in bath containing `$CuSO_4$`, HCHO, EDTA, NaOH; copper deposits on surfaces and via walls.

**2️⃣ Equations (LaTeX):**  
```latex
$$SnCl_2 + Pd^{2+} \rightarrow Pd^0 + Sn^{4+}$$  
$$CuSO_4 + HCHO + NaOH \rightarrow Cu + Byproducts$$
````

**3️⃣ Sources:**

* PDF Page 12, Section “Electroless Plating Process”

**4️⃣ Diagram (optional placeholder):**
